This assignment was to create a minesweeper clone using an existing API.  While working on it, I had a conversation about the film Mean Girls and decided to do a Mean Girls theme. Mainly, so when someone loses, it says "you can't sit with us!"

Based on some quick research, this is the closest font I could get that matched the logo for free.  Supposedly, they used a version of Futura.
